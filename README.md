# BMI Calculator App

This is a simple **BMI** (Body Mass Index) calculator application that allows users to calculate their BMI based on weight and height. 

The app supports both metric (kg and cm) and imperial (lb and ft) units, and it dynamically changes the color of the BMI value based on the BMI category. Additionally, the app includes a history screen displaying the 10 most recent measurements, an informative description of the BMI, and an about-me section.

## Technologies
This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **Android Studio:** The official IDE for Android app development.
